intro: "Examine how your county compares to others in terms of social needs and health outcomes, and explore possible intervention areas that may improve health outcomes."

howto: "This fingerprint chart visualizes how well your county and (optional) comparison county are doing in 6 social determinants of health pillars, as specified by the Kaiser Family Foundation: <br> 
<ul>
                      <li>Neighborhood & Physical Environment</li>
                      <li>Economic Stability</li>
                      <li>Health Care System</li>
                      <li>Community</li>
                      <li>Food</li>
                      <li>Education</li>
                      </ul> <br>
                      Axes expanded towards the outer circular perimeter indicate the county is strong in that area, and axes closer to the center of the circle indicate the county is weaker in that area. For example, a county with a score of 0.93 in the Health Care System pillar has a relatively small uninsured population and a large availability of hospitals and doctors. A county with a score of 0.22 in the Economic Stability pillar has relatively high unemployment and weak job growth."
density_howto: "A density plot visualizes the distribution of data (in this case, the health outcomes across counties). The chart is essentially a smoothed histogram. The peaks of a density plot show where the health outcome value is most frequent across counties."

my_matches_tab: "This tab displays the radar charts of 20 counties in your state that are most similar to yours in terms of demographics and social needs, as identified by a machine learning algorithm."
my_matches: "These are the social determinants of health of 20 counties in your state that are most similar to yours in terms of demographics and social needs, as identified by a machine learning algorithm."
demographics_tab: "This section displays demographics, social determinant of health metrics, and health outcomes for the selected county and (optional) comparison county."
health_outcomes_tab: "This tab displays the distribution of health outcomes across all counties, dots along the x-axis to indicate where the top 20 most similar counties lie on the distribution, and a colored line to indicate how the selected county compares to the rest of the distribution."
map_tab: "This tab displays a map of all counties, shaded by level of similarity to the selected county."
