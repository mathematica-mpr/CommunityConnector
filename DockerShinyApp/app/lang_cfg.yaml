intro: "Examine how your county compares to others in terms of social needs and health outcomes, and explore possible intervention areas that may improve health outcomes."
howto: "The radar charts visualize how well your county and (optional) comparison county are doing in 6 social determinants of health pillars, as specified by the Kaiser Family Foundation: <br> 
<ul>
                      <li>Neighborhood & Physical Environment</li>
                      <li>Economic Stability</li>
                      <li>Health Care System</li>
                      <li>Community</li>
                      <li>Food</li>
                      <li>Education</li>
                      </ul> <br>
                      Axes expanded towards the outer circular perimeter indicate the county is strong in that area, and axes closer to the center of the circle indicate the county is weaker in that area. For example, a county with a score of 0.93 in the Health Care System pillar has a relatively small uninsured population and a large availability of hospitals and doctors. A county with a score of 0.22 in the Economic Stability pillar has relatively high unemployment and weak job growth."
